✅ **Chronological** - Timestamp ensures invoices are ordered  
✅ **Human Readable** - Clear format: INV-[BookingID]-[Time]

## 🔄 What Changed

### **BEFORE:**
```javascript
// Random format: INV689455ABC
const invoiceNumber = `INV${Date.now().toString().slice(-6)}${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 3).toUpperCase()}`;
```

### **AFTER:**
```javascript
// Clear format: INV-123-689455 (includes booking ID)
const invoiceNumber = `INV-${booking_id}-${Date.now().toString().slice(-6)}`;
```

2. **Invoice auto-created** → Invoice number: `INV-123-689455`
3. **Invoice displayed** → Shows both invoice number and booking reference
4. **Easy to track** → From invoice number alone, you know it's for booking 123

## 💡 Real-World Usage

### Customer Service Scenario:
**Customer:** "I need to check my invoice"  
**Staff:** "What's your invoice number?"  
**Customer:** "INV-123-689455"  
**Staff:** "Perfect! That's for booking #123, let me pull it up..."

### Accounting Scenario:
- Sort invoices by booking ID: Just look at the middle number
- Find all invoices for a booking: Search for `INV-123-`
- Chronological order: Last 6 digits show creation time

## 🎯 Code Location

**File:** `server/routes/invoices.js`  
**Line:** ~327  
**Function:** Auto-create invoice (GET /booking/:booking_id)

```javascript
// Generate invoice number with booking ID for easy reference
// Format: INV-[BookingID]-[Timestamp]
const invoiceNumber = `INV-${booking_id}-${Date.now().toString().slice(-6)}`;

console.log(`🔢 Generated Invoice Number: ${invoiceNumber} for Booking ID: ${booking_id}`);
```
