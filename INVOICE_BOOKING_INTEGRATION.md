# Invoice & Booking Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of payment and invoice viewing features integrated into the booking management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. **CreateBooking.jsx** - Enhanced Invoice Creation
**Location:** `src/pages/CreateBooking.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced invoice creation to include comprehensive booking details
- Added complete financial summary to invoice
- Linked invoice to booking via `bookingId` field
- Added room details, customer info, and financial breakdown

**Key Features:**
```javascript
const invoiceToSave = {
  ...invoice,
  bookingId: bookingResult.id,
  bookingRef: bookingResult.bookingReference,
  
  // Complete customer information
  customerInfo: {
    name, email, address, phone, nid
  },
  
  // Detailed room information
  roomDetails: {
    roomNumber, roomType, checkInDate, checkOutDate,
    totalNights, pricePerNight, guestCount
  },
  
  // Comprehensive financial summary
  financialSummary: {
    originalSubtotal, totalDiscount, subtotal,
    additionalTotal, tax, taxRate, total,
    totalPaid, dueAmount
  },
  
  // Status tracking
  invoiceStatus: 'unpaid' | 'partial' | 'paid',
  createdBy, createdDate
};
```

### 2. **Bookings.jsx** - Payment & Invoice Viewing UI
**Location:** `src/pages/Bookings.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added "Add Payment" button to View Booking modal
- Added "View Invoice" button to View Booking modal
- Both buttons integrated into modal-actions section

**UI Structure:**
```jsx
<div className="modal-actions">
  <button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={handleCloseViewModal}>
    Close
  </button>
  
  <button className="btn btn-info" onClick={handleAddPaymentClick}>
    <CreditCard size={20} />
    Add Payment
  </button>
  
  <button className="btn btn-success" onClick={handleViewInvoice}>
    <Eye size={20} />
    View Invoice
  </button>
</div>
```

### 3. **invoiceService.js** - Latest Invoice Retrieval
**Location:** `src/firebase/invoiceService.js`

**Existing Feature:**
- `getInvoiceByBookingId()` method already implemented
- Returns the **latest** invoice for a booking using `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- This ensures when multiple invoices exist for a booking, the most recent one is shown

**Usage:**
```javascript
const invoiceResult = await invoiceService.getInvoiceByBookingId(booking.id);
// Returns the latest invoice with all details
```

### 4. **Button Styles**
**Location:** `src/App.css`

**Existing Styles:**
- `.btn-info` - Cyan/blue theme for "Add Payment" button
- `.btn-success` - Green theme for "View Invoice" button

```css
.btn-info {
  background-color: #0ea5e9; /* Sky blue */
  color: white;
}

.btn-success {
  background-color: #10b981; /* Green */
  color: white;
}
```

## How It Works

### Creating a Booking with Invoice

1. **User Creates Booking** (CreateBooking.jsx)
   - Fills in room selection, guest info, and invoice details
   - Can add discount percentages
   - Can add additional charges
   - Can add initial payments

2. **System Saves Booking & Invoice**
   - Booking is saved to MySQL database via API
   - Invoice is saved to Firebase Firestore with complete details
   - Invoice is linked to booking via `bookingId` field

3. **Invoice Contains:**
   - Customer information (name, email, phone, address, NID)
   - Room details (number, type, dates, nights, price)
   - Financial breakdown (subtotal, discounts, charges, tax, total)
   - Payment history
   - Booking reference

### Viewing & Managing Payments

1. **Open Booking View Modal**
   - Click on any booking in the Bookings page
   - View complete financial breakdown with cards

2. **Add Payment**
   - Click "Add Payment" button in modal
   - Enter payment amount, method, reference, notes
   - Payment is saved to MySQL `payments` table
   - Booking's `paid_amount` is automatically updated
   - Payment status recalculates (unpaid → partial → paid)

3. **View Invoice**
   - Click "View Invoice" button in modal
   - System queries Firestore for latest invoice by bookingId
   - Redirects to `/invoices?id={invoiceId}`
   - Shows complete invoice with all details

## Data Flow
