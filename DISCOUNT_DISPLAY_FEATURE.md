# Discount Display Feature - Booking Details Modal

## Overview
Enhanced the booking details modal to clearly display discount information including:
- Original room price (before discount)
- Discount percentage
- Discount amount
- Final room price (after discount)

This makes it transparent to see what discount was applied when the booking was created.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates (`server/routes/bookings.js`)

#### Added Discount Percentage to Totals
```javascript
// Calculate totals
const baseAmount = parseFloat(booking.base_amount || booking.total_amount || 0);
const discountPercentage = parseFloat(booking.discount_percentage || 0);  // ✅ NEW
const discountAmount = parseFloat(booking.discount_amount || 0);
const roomTotal = baseAmount - discountAmount;
```

#### Updated Response Object
```javascript
totals: {
  baseAmount,           // Original price
  discountPercentage,   // ✅ NEW - Discount % (e.g., 10)
  discountAmount,       // Discount amount (e.g., ৳1000)
  roomTotal,            // Price after discount
  additionalCharges,
  subtotal,
  vat,
  grandTotal,
  totalPaid,
  balance
}
```

### 2. Frontend Updates (`src/pages/Bookings.jsx`)

#### Enhanced Financial Summary Display

**Before:**
- Only showed "Room Charges" (final amount after discount)
- No visibility into discount details

**After:**
```jsx
{/* Original Room Charges */}
🏷️ Original Room Price          ৳6688.00

{/* Discount Information */}
🎯 Discount (10%)                -৳688.00

{/* Room Charges After Discount */}
🛏️ Room Charges (After Discount) ৳6000.00

{/* Additional Charges */}
➕ Extra Charges                 ৳0.00
```

#### Smart Display Logic
- Shows "Original Room Price" only when there's a base amount
- Shows "Discount" section only when discount was applied
- Displays discount percentage badge next to discount label
- Shows "(After Discount)" label on room charges when discount exists
- Uses different styling for each pricing element

### 3. CSS Styling (`src/booking.css`)

#### Discount Item Styling
```css
/* Discount item with yellow/amber gradient */
.charge-line-item.discount-item {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #fef3c7 0%, #fde68a 100%);
  padding: 0.75rem;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 2px dashed #f59e0b;
}

/* Discount percentage badge */
.discount-badge {
  background: #f59e0b;
  color: white;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 0.125rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
}

/* Discount value (negative amount in red) */
.charge-line-value.discount-value {
  color: #dc2626;
  background: #fee2e2;
  font-weight: 900;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(220, 38, 38, 0.15);
}
```

#### Room Total After Discount Styling
```css
/* Blue background for final room charge */
.charge-line-item.room-total-item {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #dbeafe 0%, #bfdbfe 100%);
  padding: 0.75rem;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 2px solid #3b82f6;
}

.charge-line-item.room-total-item .charge-line-value {
  background: #3b82f6;
  color: white;
  font-weight: 900;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3);
}
```
