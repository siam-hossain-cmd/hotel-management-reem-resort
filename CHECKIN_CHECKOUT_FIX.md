# Check-In/Check-Out Status Fix

## Problem Identified

The booking system had a status format mismatch between backend and frontend:

- **Backend API**: Uses `checked_in` and `checked_out` (with underscores)
- **Frontend Code**: Was checking for `checked-in` and `checked-out` (with hyphens)

This caused:
1. ‚ùå "Check Out" button not appearing for checked-in guests
2. ‚ùå "Currently Checked In" stat showing 0 even when guests were checked in
3. ‚ùå Status badge showed "CHECKED_IN" but functionality didn't work

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Status Normalization (Line 102 in Bookings.jsx)

```javascript
// BEFORE:
status: (booking.status || 'confirmed').toLowerCase(),

// AFTER:
status: (booking.status || 'confirmed').toLowerCase().replace(/_/g, '-'),
```

This converts all underscores to hyphens, ensuring consistency:
- `checked_in` ‚Üí `checked-in`
- `checked_out` ‚Üí `checked-out`

### 2. Date Validation System

Added smart date validation for check-in/check-out:

**Check-In Validation:**
- Compares check-in date with current date
- If dates match ‚Üí Proceeds immediately
- If dates don't match ‚Üí Shows warning modal with options:
  - Early Check-In (before scheduled date)
  - Late Check-In (after scheduled date)

**Check-Out Validation:**
- Compares check-out date with current date
- If dates match ‚Üí Proceeds immediately
- If dates don't match ‚Üí Shows warning modal with options:
  - Early Check-Out (before scheduled date)
  - Late Check-Out (after scheduled date)

### 3. Backend Status Flow

```
Backend API          Frontend Display
-----------          ----------------
confirmed      ‚Üí     confirmed
checked_in     ‚Üí     checked-in
checked_out    ‚Üí     checked-out
cancelled      ‚Üí     cancelled
```

## Features Now Working

### ‚úÖ Status-Based Button Display

| Booking Status | Visible Buttons |
|---------------|----------------|
| `confirmed` | Check In, View, Delete |
| `checked-in` | **Check Out**, View, Delete |
| `checked-out` | View, Delete, Invoice |

### ‚úÖ Statistics Display

```javascript
Total Bookings: bookings.length
Confirmed: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'confirmed').length
Currently Checked In: bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'checked-in').length
Today's Check-Outs: bookings with checkout date = today AND status in ['checked-in', 'confirmed']
```

### ‚úÖ Complete Check-In Flow

1. Booking starts with `confirmed` status
2. Click "Check In" button
3. System validates check-in date:
   - **If date matches**: Proceeds immediately
   - **If date differs**: Shows warning modal
4. User confirms in modal
5. Backend updates status to `checked_in`
6. Frontend receives `checked_in` and converts to `checked-in`
7. "Check Out" button appears
8. "Currently Checked In" stat increments

### ‚úÖ Complete Check-Out Flow

1. Booking has `checked-in` status
2. "Check Out" button is visible
3. Click "Check Out" button
4. System validates check-out date:
   - **If date matches**: Proceeds immediately
   - **If date differs**: Shows warning modal
5. User confirms in modal
6. Backend updates status to `checked_out`
7. Frontend receives `checked_out` and converts to `checked-out`
8. Status changes to "CHECKED OUT"
9. Room status changes to "available"

## Date Validation Modal Features

### Warning Scenarios

**Early Check-In:**
```
Expected Check-In: 17/10/2025
Today's Date: 16/10/2025
‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early check-in. The guest is checking in before the scheduled date.
```

**Late Check-In:**
```
Expected Check-In: 17/10/2025
Today's Date: 18/10/2025
‚ö†Ô∏è This is a late check-in. The guest is checking in after the scheduled date.
```

**Early Check-Out:**
```
Expected Check-Out: 20/10/2025
Today's Date: 19/10/2025
‚ö†Ô∏è The guest is checking out before the scheduled date.
```

**Late Check-Out:**
```
Expected Check-Out: 20/10/2025
Today's Date: 21/10/2025
‚ö†Ô∏è The guest is checking out after the scheduled date.
```

### Modal UI

- üé® Professional gradient header (blue theme)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning icon for date mismatches
- ‚úì Success icon for matching dates
- üìã Clear booking details display
- üéØ Color-coded info boxes
- üîò Cancel/Confirm action buttons

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Check-in button appears for confirmed bookings
- [ ] Check-out button appears for checked-in bookings
- [ ] "Currently Checked In" stat shows correct count
- [ ] Date validation triggers warning modal when dates don't match
- [ ] Can proceed with check-in/out despite date mismatch
- [ ] Room status updates to "occupied" on check-in
- [ ] Room status updates to "available" on check-out
- [ ] Status badges display correctly
- [ ] Backend API calls work correctly

## Backend Compatibility

The backend `/bookings/:id/status` endpoint accepts both formats:
- `checked-in` (frontend format)
- `checked_in` (database format)

It automatically normalizes to underscore format for database storage.

## Files Modified

1. **src/pages/Bookings.jsx**
   - Line 102: Added status normalization (underscore to hyphen conversion)
   - Added date validation logic in `handleQuickStatusChange`
   - Added check-in/check-out confirmation modal
   - Added modal state management

2. **src/booking.css**
   - Added `.checkin-checkout-modal` styles
   - Added warning/info box styles
   - Added responsive modal design

## Status Format Reference

### Frontend (Display)
- Uses hyphens: `checked-in`, `checked-out`
- Displayed as: "CHECKED IN", "CHECKED OUT"

### Backend (Database)
- Uses underscores: `checked_in`, `checked_out`
- Auto-normalized by backend API

### Conversion
```javascript
// Frontend receives from API
status: 'checked_in'

// Converted to hyphen format
.toLowerCase().replace(/_/g, '-')
// Result: 'checked-in'

// Used in all frontend comparisons
booking.status === 'checked-in' ‚úÖ
```

## Summary

The fix ensures perfect synchronization between backend and frontend status formats by:
1. Converting all underscores to hyphens on data load
2. Maintaining hyphenated format throughout frontend
3. Backend handles conversion back to underscores for database

This makes the check-in/check-out workflow fully functional with smart date validation and user-friendly warning system.
