  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  return sortedBookings.filter(booking => {
    const checkoutDate = new Date(booking.checkOutDate).toISOString().split('T')[0];
    return checkoutDate === today && 
           (booking.status === 'checked-in' || booking.status === 'confirmed');
  });
};
```

### Quick Checkout
```javascript
const handleCheckOut = async (booking) => {
  if (window.confirm(`Check out ${booking.guestName} from Room ${booking.roomNumber}?`)) {
    await handleStatusChange(booking.id, 'checked-out');
  }
};
```
