# VAT/Tax Display Feature - Booking Details Modal

## Problem Fixed
VAT/Tax was not showing in the booking details modal even though it was part of the booking calculation.

### Root Cause
The backend was hardcoded to calculate 0% VAT instead of using the actual tax data stored in the database:
```javascript
const vat = subtotal * 0.0; // 0% VAT for now, can be configured ❌
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (`server/routes/bookings.js`)

#### Before:
```javascript
const subtotal = roomTotal + additionalCharges;
const vat = subtotal * 0.0; // Always 0%
const grandTotal = subtotal + vat;
```

#### After:
```javascript
const subtotal = roomTotal + additionalCharges;

// Get VAT/Tax from booking data (use stored tax_rate and tax_amount)
const taxRate = parseFloat(booking.tax_rate || 0);
const taxAmount = parseFloat(booking.tax_amount || 0);

// If tax_amount is stored, use it; otherwise calculate from rate
const vat = taxAmount > 0 ? taxAmount : (subtotal * (taxRate / 100));

const grandTotal = subtotal + vat;
```

#### Updated Response:
```javascript
totals: {
  baseAmount,
  discountPercentage,
  discountAmount,
  roomTotal,
  additionalCharges,
  subtotal,
  taxRate,        // ✅ NEW - Tax percentage (e.g., 20)
  vat,            // ✅ NOW CALCULATED - Tax amount
  grandTotal,
  totalPaid,
  balance
}
```

### 2. Frontend Update (`src/pages/Bookings.jsx`)

#### Enhanced VAT Display:
```jsx
{bookingToView.totals.vat > 0 && (
  <div className="charge-line-item vat-item">
    <span className="charge-line-label">
      <span className="charge-line-icon">📊</span>
      VAT/Tax
      {bookingToView.totals.taxRate > 0 && (
        <span className="tax-badge">({bookingToView.totals.taxRate}%)</span>
      )}
    </span>
    <span className="charge-line-value vat-value">৳{bookingToView.totals.vat?.toFixed(2)}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. CSS Styling (`src/booking.css`)

#### VAT Item Styling:
```css
/* VAT/Tax Item with purple/indigo gradient */
.charge-line-item.vat-item {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #e0e7ff 0%, #c7d2fe 100%);
  padding: 0.75rem;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 2px solid #6366f1;
}

/* Tax percentage badge */
.tax-badge {
  background: #6366f1;
  color: white;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 0.125rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
}

/* VAT amount value */
.charge-line-value.vat-value {
  background: #6366f1;
  color: white;
  font-weight: 900;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3);
}
```

## Complete Financial Summary Display

### Example with Discount + VAT:

```
Financial Summary                    PAYMENT PENDING

🏷️ Original Room Price              ৳4,200.00
🎯 Discount (20%)                    -৳840.00
🛏️ Room Charges (After Discount)     ৳3,360.00
➕ Extra Charges                      ৳0.00
📊 VAT/Tax (5%)                      ৳168.00

💵 Grand Total        ৳3,528.00
✓  Total Paid        ৳1,000.00
⚠  Balance Due       ৳2,528.00
```

### Visual Design:

| Item | Background | Badge Color | Amount Color |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Original Price** | White | - | Dark Gray |
| **Discount** | Yellow/Amber Gradient | Orange (%) | Red |
| **Room Charges** | Blue Gradient | - | White (Blue BG) |
| **Extra Charges** | White | - | Dark Gray |
| **VAT/Tax** | Purple/Indigo Gradient | Indigo (%) | White (Indigo BG) |
| **Grand Total** | Dark Gradient | - | White |
| **Total Paid** | Green Gradient | - | Green |
| **Balance Due** | Red Gradient | - | White |

## Calculation Logic

### Priority Order:
1. **Use Stored Tax Amount** (if available)
   ```javascript
   const taxAmount = parseFloat(booking.tax_amount || 0);
   if (taxAmount > 0) {
     vat = taxAmount;  // Use exact stored amount
   }
   ```

2. **Calculate from Tax Rate** (fallback)
   ```javascript
   else {
     const taxRate = parseFloat(booking.tax_rate || 0);
     vat = subtotal * (taxRate / 100);
   }
   ```

### Why This Approach?
- **Accuracy**: Uses the exact tax amount that was calculated during booking creation
- **Consistency**: Ensures VAT matches what was charged to the customer
- **Flexibility**: Falls back to rate-based calculation if amount not stored
- **Historical Accuracy**: Preserves tax calculations even if tax rates change later
