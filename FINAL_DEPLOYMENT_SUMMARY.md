## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Node.js Version Mismatch**
**Problem:** cPanel has Node.js 18, but dependencies require Node.js 20+  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially working (frontend loads, backend may have issues)  
**Solution Options:**
1. Upgrade cPanel to Node.js 20+ (recommended)
2. Downgrade Firebase and React Router packages
3. Use external backend hosting (Heroku, Railway)

**Temporary Workaround:** App runs on Node 18 with warnings

### **Issue 2: NPM Install Errors**
**Problem:** Permission errors during dependency installation  
**Solution:** Use cPanel's "Run NPM Install" button instead of manual commands

### **Issue 3: Database Connection**
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Solution:** Changed MYSQL_HOST from external IP to `localhost`
