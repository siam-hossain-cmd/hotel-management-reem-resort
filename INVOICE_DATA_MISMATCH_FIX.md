# 🔧 Invoice Data Mismatch Fix - Bookings vs Immediate View

## ❌ Problem Identified

When comparing two invoices for the same booking:

### **Immediate View (CreateBooking)** ✅
- Shows: Discount ৳1520, VAT (10%) ৳608, Total ৳6688
- All calculations correct
- Invoice No: PREVIEW-1760696339696

### **View from Bookings Page** ❌  
- Shows: NO discount breakdown, VAT (0%) ৳0, Total ৳6688
- Missing discount details
- Wrong VAT calculation
- Invoice No: INV774056ABB, Booking Ref: BK773337T28

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The **transform functions** in Bookings, Dashboard, and CreateBookingNew pages were **not correctly mapping** all financial fields from the backend data:

### Missing Fields:
❌ `discountPercentage` - Not passed to PDF  
❌ `taxRate` - Not calculated or passed  
❌ Incorrect tax calculation logic  
❌ Missing `additionalTotal` alias  

---

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied

### Updated 3 Transform Functions:

#### 1. **src/pages/Bookings.jsx**
#### 2. **src/pages/CreateBookingNew.jsx**
#### 3. **src/pages/Dashboard.jsx**

---

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### **BEFORE (Incorrect Transform):**
```javascript
const baseAmount = parseFloat(invoice.base_amount || 0);
const discountAmount = parseFloat(invoice.discount_amount || 0);
const roomTotal = baseAmount - discountAmount;

return {
  originalSubtotal: baseAmount,
  totalDiscount: discountAmount,  // ❌ Missing discount percentage
  subtotal: roomTotal,
  tax: parseFloat(invoice.tax_amount || 0),  // ❌ No tax rate
  total: parseFloat(invoice.total || baseAmount + additionalChargesTotal)
};
```

### **AFTER (Correct Transform):**
```javascript
const baseAmount = parseFloat(invoice.base_amount || 0);
const discountPercentage = parseFloat(invoice.discount_percentage || 0);  // ✅ ADDED
const discountAmount = parseFloat(invoice.discount_amount || 0);
const roomTotal = baseAmount - discountAmount;

// Calculate tax/VAT properly
const taxRate = parseFloat(invoice.tax_rate || 0);  // ✅ ADDED
const subtotalBeforeTax = roomTotal + additionalChargesTotal;
const taxAmount = parseFloat(invoice.tax_amount || 0) || (subtotalBeforeTax * taxRate / 100);  // ✅ CALCULATED
const finalTotal = subtotalBeforeTax + taxAmount;

return {
  originalSubtotal: baseAmount,
  discountPercentage: discountPercentage,  // ✅ ADDED
  totalDiscount: discountAmount,
  subtotal: roomTotal,
  additionalChargesTotal: additionalChargesTotal,
  additionalTotal: additionalChargesTotal,  // ✅ ADDED (alias)
  taxRate: taxRate,  // ✅ ADDED
  tax: taxAmount,  // ✅ CALCULATED
  total: parseFloat(invoice.total || finalTotal),  // ✅ USES CALCULATED TOTAL
  paid: parseFloat(invoice.paid || 0),  // ✅ ADDED
  due: parseFloat(invoice.due || 0),  // ✅ ADDED
  // ... more fields
};
```

## 📋 New Fields Added

| Field | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `discountPercentage` | Number | Discount % applied | 20 |
| `taxRate` | Number | VAT/Tax % | 10 |
| `tax` | Number | Calculated tax amount | 608 |
| `additionalTotal` | Number | Alias for additionalChargesTotal | 0 |
| `paid` | Number | Alias for paidAmount | 2000 |
| `due` | Number | Alias for dueAmount | 4688 |

---

## 🧮 Calculation Logic Fixed

### **Tax/VAT Calculation:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate subtotal before tax
const subtotalBeforeTax = roomTotal + additionalChargesTotal;

// Step 2: Calculate tax amount
const taxAmount = parseFloat(invoice.tax_amount || 0) || (subtotalBeforeTax * taxRate / 100);

// Step 3: Calculate final total
const finalTotal = subtotalBeforeTax + taxAmount;
```

### **Example Calculation:**
```
Original Room Charges:     ৳7600
Discount (20%):           -৳1520
Room Charges After Discount: ৳6080
Subtotal (Before VAT):     ৳6080
VAT (10%):                +৳608
Final Total:               ৳6688
```
