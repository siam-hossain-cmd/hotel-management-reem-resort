# 🎫 Booking Reference Fix - Now Shows BK773337T28 Format!

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**BEFORE:** Invoice showed booking ID as number (e.g., `#123`)  
**NOW:** Invoice shows proper booking reference (e.g., `BK773337T28`)

---

## 📋 What Was the Issue?

In your booking list, you saw:
```
REF: BK773337T28
```

But in the invoice, it showed:
```
Booking Ref: #123  ← Just the numeric ID!
```

**Why?** The backend wasn't returning `booking_reference` field in invoice queries, so the invoice only had access to the numeric `booking_id`.

---

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. Backend Changes (`server/routes/invoices.js`)

Added `b.booking_reference` to **3 SQL queries**:

#### ✅ GET /invoices/:id (Get invoice by ID)
```sql
SELECT 
  i.id, i.invoice_number, i.booking_id, i.customer_id,
  b.booking_reference,  -- ✨ ADDED
  b.checkin_date, b.checkout_date,
  c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email,
  r.room_number, r.room_type
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON i.booking_id = b.id
...
```

#### ✅ GET /invoices/booking/:booking_id (Get invoice by booking)
```sql
SELECT 
  i.id, i.invoice_number, i.booking_id,
  b.booking_reference,  -- ✨ ADDED
  b.checkin_date, b.checkout_date,
  ...
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON i.booking_id = b.id
...
```

#### ✅ Auto-Create Invoice Re-fetch Query
```sql
SELECT 
  i.id, i.invoice_number, i.booking_id,
  b.booking_reference,  -- ✨ ADDED
  ...
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON i.booking_id = b.id
WHERE i.id = ?
```

---

### 2. Frontend Transform Functions

Updated **3 files** to pass `booking_reference`:

#### ✅ src/pages/Bookings.jsx
```javascript
return {
  id: invoice.invoice_number || `INV-${invoice.id}`,
  invoice_number: invoice.invoice_number,
  booking_id: invoice.booking_id,
  booking_reference: invoice.booking_reference, // ✨ ADDED
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

#### ✅ src/pages/CreateBookingNew.jsx
```javascript
return {
  id: invoice.invoice_number || `INV-${invoice.id}`,
  invoice_number: invoice.invoice_number,
  booking_id: invoice.booking_id,
  booking_reference: invoice.booking_reference, // ✨ ADDED
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

#### ✅ src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
```javascript
const transformedInvoice = {
  id: invoice.invoice_number || `INV-${invoice.id}`,
  invoice_number: invoice.invoice_number,
  booking_id: invoice.booking_id,
  booking_reference: invoice.booking_reference, // ✨ ADDED
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

---

### 3. PDF Generator Enhancement

Updated `src/utils/pdfGenerator.js` to prioritize `booking_reference`:

```javascript
const getBookingRef = () => {
  // Priority: booking_reference (BK773337T28) > booking_id (123)
  return invoice.booking_reference || invoice.bookingReference || 
         invoice.bookingRef || invoice.booking_id || invoice.bookingId || null;
};
```

**Smart Display:**
- If reference starts with "BK" → Show as is: `BK773337T28`
- If reference is numeric → Add "#": `#123`

```javascript
// Display logic
${getBookingRef().toString().startsWith('BK') 
  ? getBookingRef()        // Shows: BK773337T28
  : '#' + getBookingRef()  // Shows: #123
}
```
