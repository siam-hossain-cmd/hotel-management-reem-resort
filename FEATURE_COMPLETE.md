3. **💵 After Discount Price** - Price after applying discount
4. **📋 Additional Charges** - Itemized list of all extra charges with dates
5. **💸 Final Total** - Complete sum of everything

## 🗄️ Database Changes Made

### ✅ Migration Completed:

Added 3 new columns to `bookings` table:
```sql
base_amount          DECIMAL(12,2)  -- Original price before discount
discount_percentage  DECIMAL(5,2)   -- Discount % (0-100)
discount_amount      DECIMAL(12,2)  -- Discount in currency
```

**Status**: ✅ 8 existing bookings updated with base_amount

### ✅ Tables Used:
- `bookings` - Main booking data
- `booking_charges` - Additional charges (already exists)
- `payments` - Payment history (already exists)
- `customers` - Guest information (already exists)
- `rooms` - Room details (already exists)

---

## 🔧 Code Changes

### Backend (Server):

#### 1. Routes Updated (`server/routes/bookings.js`):

**POST /api/bookings**
- Now accepts: `base_amount`, `discount_percentage`, `discount_amount`
- Saves discount info when creating bookings

**GET /api/bookings/:id**
- Returns: booking with charges array
- Includes: discount fields and payment history

#### 2. Migration Script:
- `server/scripts/add_discount_fields.js` - Adds discount columns

---

### Frontend:

#### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.js`):
Added: `getBookingById(id)` method

#### 2. Bookings Page (`src/pages/Bookings.jsx`):

**handleViewBooking()** - Now fetches full booking details with charges

**View Modal** - Enhanced with financial breakdown:
- Displays base amount
- Shows discount (if > 0%)
- Lists all additional charges
- Calculates and displays totals
- Shows paid/due amounts

#### 3. Styling (`src/booking.css`):
Added: `.detail-item.full-width` class for full-width sections
