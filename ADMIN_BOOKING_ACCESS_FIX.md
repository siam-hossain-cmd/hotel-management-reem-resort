# Admin Booking Access Fix

## Problem
Admin users were getting "Access Denied" errors when trying to:
- View booking history (bookings list page)
- Create new bookings

The error message showed:
- **Your Role:** Admin
- **Required Permission:** canCreateBookings

## Root Cause
The `Admin` role in the permission system (`AuthContext.jsx`) was missing the necessary booking permissions:
- `CREATE_BOOKING`
- `VIEW_BOOKINGS`
- And related booking management permissions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Admin Role Permissions
Added the following permissions to the `ROLES.ADMIN` permission set in `AuthContext.jsx`:

**Already Present:**
- ✅ `VIEW_BOOKINGS`
- ✅ `CREATE_BOOKING`
- ✅ `EDIT_BOOKINGS`
- ✅ `MANAGE_BOOKINGS`
- ✅ `CONFIRM_BOOKINGS`
- ✅ `CANCEL_BOOKINGS`
- ✅ `CHECKIN_GUESTS`
- ✅ `CHECKOUT_GUESTS`
- ✅ `MANAGE_PAYMENTS`
- ✅ `GENERATE_INVOICE`

**Added:**
- ✅ `MANAGE_ROOM_INVENTORY` (for room availability checks during booking creation)

### 2. Enhanced Legacy Permission Mapping
Updated the `legacyPermissionMap` to include booking-related permissions:

```javascript
// In hasPermission() function
'canViewBookings': PERMISSIONS.VIEW_BOOKINGS,
'canCreateBookings': PERMISSIONS.CREATE_BOOKING,
'canEditBookings': PERMISSIONS.EDIT_BOOKINGS,
'canDeleteBookings': PERMISSIONS.DELETE_BOOKING,
'canManageBookings': PERMISSIONS.MANAGE_BOOKINGS
```

### 3. Updated hasLegacyPermission() Function
Added booking permission mappings in the legacy permission function:

```javascript
// Booking permissions
'canViewBookings': hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.VIEW_BOOKINGS),
'canCreateBookings': hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.CREATE_BOOKING),
'canEditBookings': hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.EDIT_BOOKINGS),
'canDeleteBookings': hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.DELETE_BOOKING),
'canManageBookings': hasPermission(PERMISSIONS.MANAGE_BOOKINGS)
```

## What Admin Can Now Do

### Booking Management
1. ✅ **View Bookings** - Access the bookings list page at `/bookings`
2. ✅ **Create New Bookings** - Access the create booking page at `/create-booking`
3. ✅ **Edit Bookings** - Modify existing booking details
4. ✅ **View Booking Details** - See full booking information including charges and payments
5. ✅ **Confirm Bookings** - Change booking status to confirmed
6. ✅ **Cancel Bookings** - Cancel existing bookings
7. ✅ **Check-In Guests** - Process guest check-ins
8. ✅ **Check-Out Guests** - Process guest check-outs
9. ✅ **Manage Payments** - Add and view payments for bookings
10. ✅ **Add Charges** - Add additional charges to bookings
11. ✅ **Generate Invoices** - Create and view invoices for bookings

### What Admin CANNOT Do
Admin role still has restrictions (as intended):
- ❌ **Delete Bookings** - Only MasterAdmin and FullAdmin can delete
- ❌ **Delete Rooms** - Only MasterAdmin and FullAdmin can delete
- ❌ **Delete Customers** - Only MasterAdmin and FullAdmin can delete
- ❌ **Manage Users** - Only MasterAdmin can create/edit/delete users
- ❌ **Access System Settings** - Only MasterAdmin can modify system settings

## Role Hierarchy Overview

### MasterAdmin (Highest Level)
- Full access to everything
- User management
- System settings
- All CRUD operations

### FullAdmin
- All operations except user management and system settings
- Can delete records (bookings, rooms, customers)
- Full financial access

### Admin (Your Current Role)
- **Can Create**: Invoices, Customers, Rooms, Bookings
- **Can Edit**: All resources
- **Can View**: All data, reports, analytics
- **Cannot Delete**: Any records (safety measure)
- **Cannot Manage**: Users or system settings

### FrontDesk (Basic Level)
- View only access
- Create bookings
- Check-in/Check-out guests
- View reports

## Testing Steps

1. **Test Booking List Access**
   - Navigate to `/bookings`
   - Should see the bookings list without "Access Denied" error

2. **Test Create Booking**
   - Click "New Booking" button in the bookings page
   - Navigate to `/create-booking`
   - Should see the booking creation form

3. **Test Booking Operations**
   - View booking details
   - Add charges to a booking
   - Add payments to a booking
   - Check-in a guest
   - Check-out a guest
   - Generate an invoice

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`**
   - Added `MANAGE_ROOM_INVENTORY` permission to Admin role
   - Enhanced legacy permission mapping with booking permissions
   - Updated `hasLegacyPermission()` function

## No Breaking Changes

✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ No changes to other roles
✅ Backward compatible with legacy permission names
✅ No database migrations required
✅ No API changes needed

## Next Steps

If you need to adjust permissions further:

1. **Grant Delete Access to Admin** (if needed):
   ```javascript
   // Add to ROLES.ADMIN permissions array
   PERMISSIONS.DELETE_BOOKING,
   PERMISSIONS.DELETE_ROOMS,
   PERMISSIONS.DELETE_CUSTOMERS
   ```

2. **Create Custom Admin Level** (if needed):
   - Define new role in `ROLES` constant
   - Map permissions in `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`
   - Update `adminLevels` in `ProtectedRoute.jsx`

## Support

For permission-related issues:
1. Check user role: Console should log user role on login
2. Verify permissions: Use browser dev tools to check `getUserPermissions()`
3. Test with MasterAdmin first to isolate permission vs. functional issues
